## But Why?

Adding Java to Windows PATH allows you to use **javac** and **java** commands from CLI, such as Command Prompt and Windows PowerShell. Among other things.

## Usage

1. Launch JavaPather. Program automatically lists Path Variables for Machine and User, and tries to find and list Java installations.
2. Generally, adding to User Path will suffice. Select the Java \bin you want to add (or click Custom for custom directory) and hit Add to User.
3. To manipulate Machine Path, press "Run As Administrator" to elevate.
